This module provides a perl interface to WDDX. The latest version of this
module as well as additional information can be found at
http://www.scripted.com/wddx/. For more information about WDDX please visit
http://www.wddx.org/.

This code is copyright 1999 by Scott Guelich. You may use and distribute 
this code according to the same terms that Perl is distributed.

NOTE
----

WDDX 0.171 is a minor update that fixes a bug in the Recordset object
where as_javasscript() was calling the deprecated get_field() method and
thus generating a warning. This bug was fixed in WDDX 0.17 that is
included in the WDDX SDK on the wddx.org website and on the Allaire 4.5 CD.
Therefore, so as not to get out of synch with that 0.17 version, I'm not
incrememting the primary version number but am releasing this as a minor
revision. Sorry for any confusion.


INSTALL
-------

NOTE: These modules now require the MIME::Base64 module available from CPAN,
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/MIME/. The file you want will be
named MIME-Base64-x.xx.tar.gz (where x is some digit). You also need
XML::Parser, which will be at http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/XML/
and named XML-Parser-x.xx.tar.gz. You can find help for installing both
these modules at http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/INSTALL.html.

I have been told that recent distributions of ActiveState Perl include
these modules, so Windows users should check before downloading and 
installing them.

To install the WDDX modules, use CPAN.pm. If you can't use CPAN.pm,
then follow these steps:

 1. Expand the package using one of these commands:
     tar xvfz WDDX-*.tar.gz              # If your system has GNU tar
     gzip -cd WDDX-*.tar.gz | tar xvf -  # If your tar is gzip-challenged

 2. Run the following series of commands:
     cd WDDX-*
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test

 3. You must do this step as superuser:
     make install

If you do not have superuser priveleges and your sysadmin is too unfriendly
to install this for you, then you can install this module in another
location by replacing "perl Makefile.PL" from step 2 with this (replace
/home/USER/lib with some directory on your system):

    perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/USER/lib

You can then run "make", "make test", and"make install" yourself to have
the module installed in the specified lib directory. If you do override
the install directory this way, you will need to add the following line
to the top of your scripts:

    use lib "/home/USER/lib";


Non-Unix Install
----------------

If your system does not support 'make', then you can manually copy
WDDX.pm and the WDDX folder to the site_perl folder in your Perl lib
folder. 


Refer to the POD in WDDX.pm for usage and more information.
